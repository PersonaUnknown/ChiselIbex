# Chisel Ibex
# M.S. Computer Engineering Master's Project (By Eric Tabuchi)
This repository contains the work done in order to recreate parts of the Ibex processors (originally written in SystemVerilog) with SystemVerilog generated from compiled Chisel code. The goal of this project was to place myself into the perspective of an undergraduate student learning Computer Architecture for the first time. This was a test on how well Chisel can be applied to better transition students from programming languages to the concepts of hardware design in addition to seeing if working on Chisel can also help them learn the syntax of traditional HDLs whose nomenclature appears more alien to the inexperienced.
